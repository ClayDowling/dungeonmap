dungeonmap
==========

Dungeon Map Generator via Qt Cloud Services.

Given a set of dungeon tile image files, generate a dungeon map from a
randomly selected set of dungeon tile images.


Tools
=====

User stories and task cards are currently being maintained via a tool
called kanit.  Text files, written with the RST formatting language, are
parsed to build a kanban board.

Kanit may (possibly) be installed via "pip install kanit"

If that doesn't work (because the author may be a moron), you can
download the source and install it yourself from the github repository:
